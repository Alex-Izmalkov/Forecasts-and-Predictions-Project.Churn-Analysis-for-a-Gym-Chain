# Churn-Analysis-and-Forecast-for-a-Gym-Chain

- This is a Forecasts and Predictions project I did during my studies at Practicum100.

- The task of the project is to analyze customer interaction strategies and come up with recomendations.

- The project deals with drawing up typical customer portraits, analyzing the factors that impact churn most and predicting the probability of churn for each customer. 

- For that matter, it includes with building graphs and heatmaps, examining distributions, building prediction models and creating clusters.
